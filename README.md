# Html_Practice_Lists
This repository contains a simple HTML page styled with CSS, with examples of unordered and ordered lists. The lists showcase different types of list formatting using HTML &lt;ul> and &lt;ol> tags. Additionally, it includes links to external HTML files ("intro" and "mouse") using anchor tags (&lt;a>).
